# IntelligentAgents2015
Labs of Intelligent Agents course at EPFL during autumn semester 2015

Assignment 1:
- rabbits loses energy at each run, defined by 'lossRateEnergy'. They die if their energy is less than 1.
- when a rabbit bumps into some grass, it eats all the grass (to be changed probably).
- If a rabbit wins enough energy to give birth at run i, then he will only give birth at run i+1 (like this, we are able to see in green in the display when a rabbit will give birth).
- when a rabbit gives birth, he loses 'lossReproductionEnergy' amount of energy.
- a new born rabbit is initialized in the same way as the rabbits are at the beginning.
