# Introduction

In this progamming exercise, we implement the *Pickup and Delivery* problem with deliberative agents. These agents will compute a plan for picking up and delivering tasks using different algorithms like *Breadth First Search* or $A*$ to go through a tree where each node is a state of the entire world known by the agent. The exploration of the tree stops when a goal state is reached.

In the next sections, we will first define the state representation with the goal states en the transitions between states. Then, we will present the main features of our code. Finally we will present some results given by our implementation and we will explain them.
